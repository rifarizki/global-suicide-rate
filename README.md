# Global Suicide Rate Overview from 1995-2015

Through this report, I aim to analyse the global suicide rates in 100 countries using the "Suicide Rates Overview 1985 to 2016" dataset that I obtained from Kaggle.
I also tried to limit the analysis to 10 years only, starting from the year 1995-2015. Several variables such as GDP per capita will be excluded from the analysis since
I will only focused on the trends of suicide rates in each country.

This is a complimentary data analysis for the R Shiny dashboard, which I have published under the same name with this report.
